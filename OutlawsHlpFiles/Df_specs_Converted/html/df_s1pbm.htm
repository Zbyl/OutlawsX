<P>Dark Forces contains a huge amount of files, and these are grouped by type in what are called <A HREF="df_s8stw.htm">GOB</A> files and <A HREF="df_s4j1x.htm">LFD</A> Files.</P>

<P>They serve as <B>containers</B> for other files which in turn contain information. </P>

<P>GOB Files mainly contain data for the DF engine, while LFD Files contain the data needed for the Landru system (cutscenes, menus, briefings).</P>

<H4><I>Patching</I></H4>

<P>Files can be extracted from the <A HREF="df_s8stw.htm">GOB</A> and worked upon, then be used in the game.</P>

<P>LucasArts made a very good job of this and prepared a path for users to modify levels.</P>

<P>If you want to make DF accept new or modified files, create a GOB file with them (say mylevel.gob).</P>

<P>Then use the following command line: <B>dark -umylevel.gob</B></P>

<P>The order in which DF looks for a file is as follows:</P>

<P>1) as a file in the installed directory</P>

<P>2) in the GOB specified by -u...</P>

<P>3) in its normal GOB in the installed directory</P>

<P>4) in its normal GOB on the CD</P>

<P>LFD resources can also be extracted and worked upon, but there isn't any facility to load them.</P>

<P>What you have to do is recompose the patched LFD, and set it in the installed directory, or in the LFD subdirectory of the installed directory. A LFD in the installed directory will be taken in preference to one in the LFD subdirectory with the same name.</P>

<P>Putting a patched LFD in a GOB and loading it with -u doesn't work.</P>
