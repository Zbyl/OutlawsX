<P>Teleporter chutes are a special class of their own. Their function is to teleport the player directly up or down to another sector.</P>

<P>Dark Forces teleporter chutes are not deliberate teleporters like in  DOOM. They are usually not intended to be noticed, and are intended to  make it look like the player has just fallen through a chute into a layer  below, for example, in the Robotics Facility where you fall into the gas  room, and Jabba's Ship where you fall into the area where you rescue Jan.  These cases need to use teleporter chutes because it is impossible to use  the same sector in both layers - its walls would need to be given double  adjoins!</P>

<P>Because teleporter chutes send you to the same X and Z coordinates, the target sector MUST occupy the same physical space of the teleporter chute, or  it may be possible to teleport outside of a sector. Of course your Y coordinate can change.</P>
