<P>1--------2    Sector 1 has 5 vertices (0 to 4) marked 0 1 2 A B</P>

<P>|        |                 5 walls    including AB (wall 3)</P>

<P>|   S1   |</P>

<P>|        |    Sector 2 has 4 vertices (0 to 3) marked 0 1 B A</P>

<P>0---B====A                 4 walls    including BA (wall 2)</P>

<P>| S2 |</P>

<P>1----0</P>

<P>It is VERY important to note that there are 2 vertices at point A, two vertices at point B and 2 walls marked ==== . As I said earlier, sectors are self contained.</P>

<P>So, to come back to the adjoin/mirror/walk mechanism, if S1 and S2 must be connected, an adjoin/mirror relation must be established.</P>

<P>+----1---+</P>

<P>|        |</P>

<P>0        2</P>

<P>| 4    3 |</P>

<P>+---+====+</P>

<P>1  2 3</P>

<P>+--0-+</P>

<P>This is quite simple : the adjoin is the number of the connected sector, and the mirror is the number of the connection wall.</P>

<P>So we would need to set:</P>

<P>in S1 : W3.adjoin = S2 and W3.mirror = 2</P>

<P>in S2 : W2.adjoin = S1 and W2.mirror = 3</P>

<P>If there is no adjoin/mirror relationship, the values for adjoin and mirror will be -1.</P>

<P>Walk values seem to have no effect at all in a level, but they are mostly set to the same value as adjoin.</P>
