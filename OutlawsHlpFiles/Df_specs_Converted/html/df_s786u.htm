<P>This is used specifically for switches. Remember, the wall containing the switch must have a sign which is a switch texture.  When the switch is pressed, the first texture will change to  the second texture in the multiple bm. The second texture can't  be pressed - a <A HREF="df_s0ptc.htm">message: done</A> must be sent to change  the switch back to the first texture. This can be done as many times as you like.</P>
