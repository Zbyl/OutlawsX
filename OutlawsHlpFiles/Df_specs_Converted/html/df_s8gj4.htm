<P>The GOB structure is quite similar to that of a WAD file, the small difference is that in wads the MASTERN field is at the beginning of the file, between WAD_MAGIC and MASTERX.</P>

<P>Of course, the WAD_MAGIC is 'PWAD' or 'IWAD', not 'GOB' followed by 0x0A.</P>

<P>This distinction between master (IWAD) and patches (PWAD) doesn't exist in DF.</P>
