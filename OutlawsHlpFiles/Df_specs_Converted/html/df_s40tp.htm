<P>[by Anthony Hall]</P>

<P>The texture: command's format is like this:</P>

<P>texture: [stopnum] [flag] [donor]</P>

<P>This command will copy the texturing from one specified sector to another one.  It must be used in the INF entry of the sector that will be changed. [donor] is the sector to copy a texture from.  The flag tells whether to copy ceiling to ceiling texture or floor to floor.  If the flag starts with a letter then ceiling textures will be used.  If it's a number then floors will be used.</P>

<P>I haven't been able to get it to work with walls or in trigger INF entries though.</P>
