<P>In Doom, the equivalent to an Adjoin/Mirror is the sharing of two vertices and a linedef between two sectors.</P>

<P>Contrary to a DF Wall, the linedef doesn't contain texturing information, this one being coded at the sidedef level.</P>

<P>There is no node building (BSP) to do on these levels.</P>

<P>There certainly are checks at level loading time, but a few tests on complicated sectors seem to show 'errors' in texturing or HOM problems.</P>

<P>In fact, it seems that big non-convex sectors are problematic.</P>

<P>Maybe you just have to try and create a few 'more convex' sectors instead.</P>
