<H4><A NAME="3h1obu"></A>Limitations on objects</H4>

<P>[by Daron Stinnett, DF Project Leader]</P>

<P>There is no maximum for objects in a sector. </P>

<P>However there can only be a total of 512 objects in the level.</P>

<P>Also you can only load up 64 each of PODs, FMEs, and WAXs.</P>

<P>So you could have 1 FME and 512 objects that use that FME.</P>

<P><B>Notes</B></P>

<P>This limitation has probably been removed, because you <B>can</B> use more than 512 objects in a level and all work well.</P>

<P>On the other hand, there is a limit to the number of objects that can be <B>displayed</B> (or active ?) at a given time.</P>

<P>When you reach it objects begin to flicker in and out, enemies don't appear but do fire at you, etc.</P>

<P>It begins at around 500 objects too…</P>
