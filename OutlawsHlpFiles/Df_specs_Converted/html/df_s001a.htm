<P>GOBS are quite similar in principle to DOOM WAD files, but at a higher level.</P>

<P>In fact, WADS directly contain the information or resources, but GOBS also contain complex files, themselves still containing multiple resources.</P>

<P>dark -umygob.gob is nearly equivalent to doom -file mywad.wad</P>

<P>You cannot however load multiple gobs in DF as you can load multiple wads in DOOM.</P>
